 * Things to note:
 * Note the { } curly braces.  It's a standard delimiter in Java.  
 * One set of curly braces shows the scope of the class, another set of curly braces
 *      shows the scope of a given method.
 * Java is case-sensitive.  'System' is the not the same as 'system'.
 * Statements are terminated by a semicolon (;)  
 * 
 * Things to consider:
 * What is a package?
 * What does 'public' modifier mean?
 * What does 'static' keyword do?
