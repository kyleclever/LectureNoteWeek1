/*
 * Notes - Introduction to methods.  
 * 
 * Things to note:
 * 
 * This class has three methods (besides main).  Two methods called AddNumbers and one method called AddNumber1.
 * 
 * Note the method signatures for the two 'AddNumbers' methods.  The method signature is the first part of the 
 * method code, minus the mutator.
 * 
 * Method signature : static void AddNumbers()
 * Method signature : static void AddNumbers(int a, int b)
 * 
 * The difference between the two methods...  is the parameters being passed.  This is a KEY OO CONCEPT called 
 * Overloading.  You can have two methods with the same
 * method name as long as they have a different parameter list.  
 * The first method doesn't have any parameters, the second has two parameters.
 * 
 * Things to consider:
 * Look at AddNumbers().  What is the scope for variables a, b, c?
 * Look at AddNumbers1(int a, int b).  What is the scope for variables a, b?
 * What does 'void' mean?
